🗂️ **1. Dataset Details**

🧹 **2. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)**

Before creating visuals, the dataset was prepared using Power Query:

* Removed duplicates and empty rows
* Standardized column names and data types (date, text, number)
* Cleaned product and retailer fields
* Checked for missing values
* Formatted date column for time-based analysis

✅ No advanced calculations or DAX were used—only basic cleaning steps.

🔗 **3. Data Modeling**

Since this is a single-table basic project:

* A simple data model was used
* All insights were derived directly from the cleaned dataset
* No relationships or complex models were required

✅ This makes the project beginner-friendly.

📊 **4. Dashboard & Visualizations**

A set of simple visuals were used to understand sales performance:

* **Bar/Column Charts:** Sales by region, retailer, and product
* **Line Chart:** Sales trend over time
* **Map Visual:** Sales distribution across US states/regions
* **Table:** Detailed view of sales records
* **Card Visuals:** Key summary statistics (Total Sales, Units Sold, etc.)
* **Slicers/Filters:** Region, product, retailer, year/month

✅ These visuals allow users to explore the data interactively.

 🎯 **5. Key Insights Identified**

The dashboard helps answer important business questions like:

* Which region generated the highest sales?
* Which products performed best?
* Which retailer contributed the most?
* How did sales change over time?

These insights help understand patterns and performance differences across the US market.

 🚀 **6. Outcome of the Project**

This project demonstrates:

* Ability to import, clean, and format data
* Basic Power BI dashboard design
* Interactive reporting using visuals and slicers
* Skills in summarizing large datasets into easy-to-read insights

It serves as a solid foundation for future advanced dashboards using DAX and relationships.


✅ **Conclusion**

The Adidas Sales Dashboard effectively turns raw data into a clear visual story. Even without advanced formulas, the project shows how Power BI can be used to identify trends, compare regions and products, and support data-driven understanding of business performance.
